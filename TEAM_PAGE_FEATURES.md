## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Managers

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Check Team page for overnight bug assignments
2. **Planning**: Review workload before assigning new tasks
3. **Standups**: Use as reference for discussion
4. **End of Day**: Verify all critical bugs are assigned

### Best Practices
- âœ… Balance workload across team members
- âœ… Don't overload high performers
- âœ… Assign based on expertise and availability
- âœ… Monitor "In Progress" count daily
- âœ… Use workload indicators before assignments

### Red Flags
- ðŸš© Multiple team members with high (red) workload
- ðŸš© Team members with no assignments (potential under-utilization)
- ðŸš© Critical bugs assigned to already overloaded developers
- ðŸš© Large difference in workload between team members
