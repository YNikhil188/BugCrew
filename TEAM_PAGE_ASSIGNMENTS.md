# Team Page - Direct Assignment Feature

## 🎯 Overview
Managers can now assign bugs and projects directly from the Team Page to developers and testers. Assigned items automatically appear in the respective dashboards.

---

## ✅ New Features

### 1. **Assignment Buttons on Team Cards** ✅
Each team member card now has assignment buttons (visible only to managers):

**For ALL team members (Developers + Testers)**:
- 📁 **"Assign Project"** button - Assigns projects to the member

**For Developers ONLY**:
- 🐛 **"Assign Bug"** button - Assigns bugs to the developer

**For Testers**:
- Only the "Assign Project" button is visible
- Bug assignment button is hidden (testers cannot receive bugs)

### 2. **Assign Bug Modal** ✅
When manager clicks "Assign Bug":
- Modal opens showing member's name and role
- Dropdown lists all unassigned or open bugs
- Each bug shows: `[PRIORITY] Title - Project Name`
- Checkbox to send email notification
- Validates that only developers can receive bugs

### 3. **Assign Project Modal** ✅
When manager clicks "Assign Project":
- Modal opens showing member's name and role
- Dropdown lists all projects not yet assigned to this member
- Each project shows: `Name - Status`
- Both developers and testers can be assigned
- Prevents duplicate assignments

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### File: `frontend/src/pages/TeamPage.js`

**New State Variables**:
```js
const [showAssignBugModal, setShowAssignBugModal] = useState(false);
const [showAssignProjectModal, setShowAssignProjectModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedMember, setSelectedMember] = useState(null);
const [selectedBugId, setSelectedBugId] = useState('');
const [selectedProjectId, setSelectedProjectId] = useState('');
const [sendEmail, setSendEmail] = useState(true);
```

**Assignment Handlers**:
```js
const handleAssignBug = async (e) => {
  // Calls PUT /api/bugs/:id/assign
  // Passes userId and sendEmail flag
};

const handleAssignProject = async (e) => {
  // Calls PUT /api/projects/:id
  // Adds member to project.team array
};
```

**Helper Functions**:
```js
const getAvailableBugs = () => {
  // Returns unassigned bugs for developers
  // Filters: !assignedTo OR status === 'open'
};

const getAvailableProjects = () => {
  // Returns projects not yet assigned to member
  // Filters: project not in member's current projects
};
```

---

## 📊 Dashboard Integration

### Developer Dashboard
After assignment, developers see:

**Kanban Board**:
- New bugs appear in **"To Do"** column (status: open or reopened)
- Assigned bugs appear in **"In Progress"** column (status: in-progress)
- Status can be updated via dropdown

**Projects Section**:
- Assigned projects appear with progress bars
- Shows project name, deadline, completion percentage
- Animated progress bars with color coding

### Tester Dashboard
After project assignment, testers see:

**Projects Section**:
- Assigned projects displayed with details
- Can view project information
- See team members on the project

**My Reports Section**:
- Bugs they've reported
- Can verify resolved bugs
- Can reopen bugs if needed

---

## 🔐 Permission Enforcement

### Frontend Validation:
1. **Assignment buttons**: Only visible to managers
2. **Bug assignment**: Only shows "Assign Bug" button for developers
3. **Available bugs**: Only shows unassigned bugs in dropdown
4. **Available projects**: Only shows projects not already assigned

### Backend Validation:
1. **Bug assignment**: Validates role === 'developer'
   ```js
   if (assignee.role !== 'developer') {
     return res.status(400).json({ 
       message: 'Bugs can only be assigned to developers' 
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Project assignment**: Accepts all team members (dev + tester)
3. **Authorization**: Only managers and admins can make assignments
