# Logo Setup Instructions

Please save the BugCrew logo image as:
`bugcrew-logo.png`

in this directory (`frontend/public/images/`).

The logo should be the image with:
- Bug icon on the left
- "Bugcrew" text in green/orange
- Tagline "TRACK. FIX. DELIVER BETTER." in pink/magenta

The logo will automatically appear on:
- Landing page (600px max-width)
- Login page (400px max-width)

Both pages have been updated to use the image logo instead of the emoji.
