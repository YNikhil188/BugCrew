## 📊 Data Management

### Bug Report Structure
```javascript
{
  _id: "...",
  title: "Login button not responsive on mobile",
  description: "When clicking login on iPhone, nothing happens",
  project: { _id: "...", name: "Mobile App" },
  priority: "critical",
  severity: "major",
  type: "bug",
  status: "open",
  reporter: { _id: "...", name: "Tester Name" },
  assignedTo: null, // or { _id: "...", name: "Developer" }
  stepsToReproduce: "1. Open app on iPhone\n2. Go to login\n3. Click button",
  environment: "iOS 17, Safari",
  screenshots: ["screenshot1.png", "screenshot2.png"],
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Filtering Logic
```javascript
// Status filter
const statusMatch = filterStatus === 'all' || bug.status === filterStatus;

// Priority filter
const priorityMatch = filterPriority === 'all' || bug.priority === filterPriority;

// Combined filter
return statusMatch && priorityMatch;
```

## 💡 Tips for Testers

### Effective Bug Reporting
1. **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive, actionable titles
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Explain what happened vs. what should happen
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Number steps clearly
4. **Screenshots**: Upload relevant images showing the issue
5. **Environment Details**: Include browser, OS, screen size
6. **Priority**: Choose appropriate priority level

### Priority Guidelines
- **🔴 Critical**: App crashes, data loss, security issues
- **🟠 High**: Major features broken, affects many users
- **🟡 Medium**: Minor features broken, workarounds exist
- **🟢 Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconveniences

### Best Practices
- ✅ Report bugs immediately when found
- ✅ One bug per report (don't combine issues)
- ✅ Use filters to track your bugs
- ✅ Add comments with additional findings
- ✅ Verify fixes when status changes to "Resolved"
- ✅ Be specific in reproduction steps
- ✅ Include actual vs. expected behavior

### What Makes a Good Bug Report
**Good Example**:
```
Title: "Add to Cart button doesn't work on product page"
Description: "When clicking the 'Add to Cart' button on any product page, 
nothing happens. The cart count doesn't increase and no confirmation appears."
Steps: 
1. Navigate to any product page
2. Click "Add to Cart" button
3. Observe no response
Environment: Chrome 120, Windows 11, 1920x1080
Priority: High
```

**Bad Example**:
```
Title: "Cart broken"
Description: "Cart doesn't work"
Steps: (empty)
Environment: (empty)
Priority: Low
```
