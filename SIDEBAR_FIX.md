# Sidebar Navigation Fix

## Problem
All sidebar links were redirecting to the landing page because the routes didn't exist in the React Router configuration.

## Solution
Created placeholder pages and added all necessary routes to App.js.

## New Files Created

1. **UsersPage.js** - User management page (Admin only)
2. **ProjectsPage.js** - Projects page (all roles)
3. **BugsPage.js** - Bug tracking page (all roles)
4. **GenericPage.js** - Reusable page for Reports, Settings, Team, Profile

## Routes Added to App.js

### Admin Routes
- `/admin/dashboard` ✅
- `/admin/users` ✅ NEW
- `/admin/projects` ✅ NEW
- `/admin/bugs` ✅ NEW
- `/admin/reports` ✅ NEW
- `/admin/settings` ✅ NEW

### Manager Routes
- `/manager/dashboard` ✅
- `/manager/projects` ✅ NEW
- `/manager/team` ✅ NEW
- `/manager/bugs` ✅ NEW
- `/manager/reports` ✅ NEW

### Developer Routes
- `/developer/dashboard` ✅
- `/developer/bugs` ✅ NEW
- `/developer/projects` ✅ NEW
- `/developer/profile` ✅ NEW

### Tester Routes
- `/tester/dashboard` ✅
- `/tester/bugs` ✅ NEW
- `/tester/mybugs` ✅ NEW
- `/tester/projects` ✅ NEW

## Bug Fixed
Fixed typo in Sidebar.js: `/tester/mybugss` → `/tester/mybugs`

## How to Test

1. Login to the application with any role
2. Click on sidebar links (Users, Projects, Bugs, Reports, Settings, etc.)
3. Each link should now navigate to the correct page with proper content
4. The active link should be highlighted in the sidebar

## Next Steps

You can now expand these placeholder pages with:
- Data fetching from backend API
- CRUD forms and modals
- Tables with search and filtering
- More animations and interactions

All pages follow the same structure:
- Sidebar component
- Navbar component  
- Main content area with animations
- Consistent styling

Happy coding! 🐛✨
